                        <p class="text-muted">Women play a vital role in the tech industry, bringing diverse perspectives and skill sets to the table. It is important to promote gender diversity in this field, not only to address issues of inequality, but also to improve innovation and overall performance. Encouraging women to pursue careers in tech and supporting them in their professional development can lead to a more inclusive and dynamic industry.

                            Women have long faced discrimination because of their gender, and the realm of technology is no exception. As a result, the IEEE YP Bangalore and IEEE SB CUK's WiE Affinity Group hosted a panel discussion titled *Break N Fix* with some tech experts to offer a clear picture of how gender bias has captured technology.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p class="text-muted">Full stack development refers to the process of designing and developing software applications that incorporate both front-end and back-end development. Full stack developers are skilled in multiple programming languages and technologies, allowing them to develop applications that are both functional and visually appealing. They must be familiar with both client-side and server-side development and possess a deep understanding of web architecture and software design principles. Full stack development is a critical aspect of modern software development, as it allows developers to create scalable and efficient applications that can run on multiple platforms and devices.
