                        <p class="text-muted">Women play a vital role in the tech industry, bringing diverse perspectives and skill sets to the table. It is important to promote gender diversity in this field, not only to address issues of inequality, but also to improve innovation and overall performance. Encouraging women to pursue careers in tech and supporting them in their professional development can lead to a more inclusive and dynamic industry.

                            Women have long faced discrimination because of their gender, and the realm of technology is no exception. As a result, the IEEE YP Bangalore and IEEE SB CUK's WiE Affinity Group hosted a panel discussion titled *Break N Fix* with some tech experts to offer a clear picture of how gender bias has captured technology.</p>
